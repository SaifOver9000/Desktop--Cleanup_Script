# Desktop--Cleanup_Script

This project aims to create a constantly running Python script that cleans up and organises your desktop files. 
[I want to eventually expand to organising any directory that the user wishes]
maybe implement an interface, they can drag and drop messy directories/ or just enter the path and will organise based on preferences
I will be using Python to complete this project.

Requirements:

**Move files around**

**Create New folders**

**Sort the files in the folders based on several categories(Date, file type, etc..).**

**Run in the background**
